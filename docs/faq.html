            <h1>Basketball Team Manager - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>

<strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 27, 2025
<strong>Version:</strong> 1.0.0

<h2 id="General Questions">General Questions</h2>

<h3>What is Basketball Team Manager?</h3>

<p>Basketball Team Manager is a comprehensive mobile application designed to help basketball coaches, team managers, and players organize and manage their basketball teams. The app allows you to track players, schedule games and practices, record statistics, create lineups, and communicate with your team—all from your Android device.</p>

<h3>Is the app free to use?</h3>

<p>Yes, Basketball Team Manager is free to download and use. The app is ad-supported, meaning you may see advertisements while using the app. We may offer a premium version in the future that removes ads and provides additional features.</p>

<h3>What devices are supported?</h3>

<p>Basketball Team Manager supports Android devices running Android 8.0 (Oreo / API level 26) or higher.</p>

<h3>Do I need an internet connection to use the app?</h3>

<p>No, Basketball Team Manager works completely offline. All your data is stored locally on your device. However, an internet connection is required for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial app setup and configuration</li>
<li>Viewing advertisements</li>
<li>Accessing help resources and legal documents</li>
<li>Future cloud backup features (if implemented)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Account & Authentication">Account & Authentication</h2>

<h3>How do I create an account?</h3>

<p>1. Open the Basketball Team Manager app</p>
<p>2. Tap "Register" on the login screen</p>
<p>3. Enter your full name, email address, and password</p>
<p>4. Tap "Register" to create your account</p>
<p>5. Complete the team setup process</p>

<p>Note: Your credentials are stored securely and locally on your device only.</p>

<h3>Is my password secure?</h3>

<p>Yes. Your password is encrypted using Android's EncryptedSharedPreferences with AES256-GCM encryption. Your password never leaves your device and is not transmitted to any server.</p>

<h3>What if I forget my password?</h3>

<p>Since all data is stored locally on your device and there is no cloud backup, forgotten passwords cannot be recovered. You will need to reinstall the app and create a new account, which will result in losing all previously stored data.</p>

<strong>Recommendation:</strong> Remember your password or use a password manager.

<h3>Can I use the app on multiple devices?</h3>

<p>Currently, each device maintains its own separate data. There is no cloud synchronization, so data entered on one device will not appear on another device.</p>
